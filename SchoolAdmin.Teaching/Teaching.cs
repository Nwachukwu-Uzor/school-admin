// A Teacher class with the following features:
// Properties: StaffId (int, readonly), Name (string, readonly), Subject (string), Learners (string array)
// Methods: Teach()
// It should have a constructor that takes in the teacherâ€™s ID number and full name as parameters.
// It should store both values in private fields, hidden from other classes.
// It should expose these values via the public properties, in readonly form.
// Put the Teacher class in a SchoolAdmin.Teaching namespace.
